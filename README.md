# Gonzalez-Rubioetal_2019_ExplicitTemporalControl

The code included in these files can be used along with the data available in OSF (https://osf.io/eq6f9/) and Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/ExplicitTemporal_SpatialModulations_mat/8145962) to replicate the findings on Gonzalez-Rubio et al., 2019 ( https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00207).

Run the function called "ExplicitControlofStepTimeStudy_PublicationReproducibility" which is under "FigureFunctions". Consider that "StudyData" needs to be loaded to the workspace in order to be able to generate the figures from the paper.

Here is a list of the names of the parameters in the code and their correspondence to the paper: 
-'Sout' -> 'Sout'
-'Tout' -> 'Tout' 
-'Serror' -> 'Leg Orientation Asymmetry (SA)'
-'Terror' -> 'DS Time Asymmetry (TA)' 
-'Sgoal' -> 'Range of Motion Asymmetry (SnA)' 
-'Tgoal' -> 'Stance Time Asymmetry (TnA)'

Name correspondence in the code for the groups:
-'StepTimeStudyControl' -> 'Control' 
-'StepTimeStudy' -> 'Temporal Feedback' 
-'AlphaFeedback' -> 'Spatial Feedback'

Name correspondence in the code for the epochs: 
-'InitialWash' -> 'After-Effects' 
-'TMsteady' -> 'Steady State'
